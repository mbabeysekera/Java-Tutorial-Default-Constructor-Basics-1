Default constructor to set Private variables inside the class

Author: @ BUDDHIKA ABEYSEKERA.
 
 In this tutorial what I am going to focus on are the Default Constructor and its behavior.
 In my previous tutorial on Inheritance, in order to create a setter method I used a public method 
 to assign values or parameters to private variables in the class.
 Here I am going to use Default constructor to do the same thing.
